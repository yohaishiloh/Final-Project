# Simplified DLX – Baseline Core (Verilog)

This folder contains the single-core DLX baseline used as a reference.

---

## What’s Here
- A simplified DLX CPU (as implemented in ACSL course)
- Minimal instruction set subset compatible with provided assembly samples
- Ready to be integrated as a single core or as the building block for the multicore system

---

## Usage
- Simulate standalone to validate the ISA behavior
- Compare performance vs. `Multicore/` design
- Helpful for unit tests of instruction fetch/execute without coherence logic
